# ownmine 2.0

**Simple automation toolkit for self-hosted Minecraft servers**

ðŸš§ **Version 2 is in development!**

I'm migrating the collection of Bash scripts to a minimalist local client/server tool written in **Python 3.11+**. This will finally allow support for **multiple Minecraft server instances**, background execution, and improved flexibility.

If you're checking out this branch, stay tuned ðŸ˜‰
