**Simple automation scripts for self-hosted Minecraft servers**

ðŸš§ **Version 2** is under progress.

I'm migrating the collection of Bash scripts to a minimalist local client/server tool implemented in Python 3.11+. This will allow the support of multiple instances of Minecraft Server (finally!).

If you're checking this branch, stay tuned ðŸ˜‰
